abstract = {Single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has become a versatile and widespread method to probe nanoscale conformation and dynamics. However, current experimental modalities often resort to molecule immobilization for long obser- vation times and do not always approach the resolution limit of FRET-based nanoscale metrology. Here we present ABEL-FRET, an immobilization-free platform for smFRET measurements with ultrahigh resolving power in FRET efficiency. Importantly, single-molecule diffusivity is used to provide additional size and shape information for hydrodynamic profiling of individual molecules, which, together with the concurrently measured intramolecular conformation through FRET, enables a holistic and dynamic view of biomolecules and their complexes.},
