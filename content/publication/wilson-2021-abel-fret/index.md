abstract: Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has become a
  versatile and widespread method to probe nanoscale conformation and dynamics. 
  However, current experimental modalities often resort to molecule immobilization 
  for long observation times and do not always approach the resolution limit of 
  FRET-based nanoscale metrology. Here we present ABEL-FRET, an immobilization-free 
  platform for smFRET measurements with ultrahigh resolving power in FRET efficiency. 
  Importantly, single-molecule diffusivity is used to provide additional size and shape 
  information for hydrodynamic profiling of individual molecules, which, together with 
  the concurrently measured intramolecular conformation through FRET, enables a holistic 
  and dynamic view of biomolecules and their complexes.
