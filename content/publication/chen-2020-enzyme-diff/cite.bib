abstract = {Theoretical and experimental observations that catalysis enhances the diffusion of enzymes have generated exciting implications about nanoscale energy flow, molecular chemotaxis and self-powered nanomachines. However, contradictory claims on the origin, magnitude, and consequence of this phenomenon continue to arise. Experimental observations of catalysis-enhanced enzyme diffusion, to date, have relied almost exclusively on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a technique that provides only indirect, ensemble-averaged measurements of diffusion behavior. Here, using an Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap and in-solution spectroscopy (FCS), a technique that provides only indirect, ensemble-averaged measurements of diffusion behavior. Here, using an Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap and in-solution single-particle tracking (SPT), we show that catalysis does not increase the diffusion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at the single-molecule level, in sharp contrast to the $\sim$20% enhancement seen in parallel FCS experiments using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Combining comprehensive FCS controls, ABEL trap, surface-based single-molecule fluorescence, and Monte-Carlo simulations, we establish that pNPP-induced dye blinking at the $\sim$10 ms timescale is responsible for the apparent diffusion enhancement seen in FCS. Our observations urge a crucial revisit of various experimental findings and theoretical models––including those of our own––in the field, and indicate that in-solution SPT and ABEL trap are more reliable means to investigate diffusion phenomena at the nanoscale.},
