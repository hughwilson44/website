experience:
#  - title: Ph.D. Candidate, Lewis-Sigler Institute, Princeton University
#    company: Principal Investigator: Dr Quan Wang 
#    date_start: '2015-09-01'
#    date_end: ''
#    description: Developed a new single-molecule measurement platform, which combines Forster resonance energy transfer measurements with algorithms to infer the single-molecule diffusion coefficient and electrokinetic mobility, enabling extraction of dynamic structural information from individual biomolecular complexes in solution. Applied this platform to study protein-nucleic acid interactions in the context of DNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly.
